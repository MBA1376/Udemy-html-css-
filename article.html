					<p>The definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified.
					There is one definite article in English, for both singular and plural nouns: the:


					The sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home; it contrasts with the much more general observation that:

					Children know the fastest ways home.

					<p>
					The latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home. Likewise,

					Give me the book. refers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener; as such it has a markedly different meaning from

					Give me a book. which uses an indefinite article, which does not specify what book is to be given.

					The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:

					The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.

					However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.

					<h3>Partitive article</h3>
					<p>
						A partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article,
						they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in 
						English is some, although the latter is classified as a determiner but not in all authorities' classifications as an indefinite article, and English uses it less than French uses de.

						
						For more information, see the article on the French partitive article.
